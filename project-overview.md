# Project Overview

Project Name: Cryp0to Play

Description: A gamified web application that makes it fun and easy to deploy NFT and token smart contracts on multiple blockchains.

Features:

*   Blockchain Agnostic: Support for multiple blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Solana) with a unified interface.
*   Gamified Contract Creation: A visual, drag-and-drop interface for defining contract parameters (token name, supply, NFT metadata, royalties, etc.).
*   Simulated Deployments: A "sandbox" mode where users can test their contracts on a testnet without spending real funds.
*   Learning Resources: Integrated tutorials and documentation to help users understand the basics of smart contracts and blockchain technology.
*   NFT Generator: A simple tool for generating NFT art from templates or uploading custom images.

Target Audience: Aspiring crypto developers, artists, and anyone interested in creating their own NFTs and tokens without writing code.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
*   Web requests to access blockchain APIs for smart contract deployment.
*   Gamification library for the user interface.
